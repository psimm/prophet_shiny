### Number of changepoints

Number of potential changepoints to include. Sets how many changes in the trend direction or steepness Prophet will try to fit to. Higher values create more flexible lines that are closer to historic data.

Try setting this to just 1 or 2 changepoints and observe how the forecast changes as you add more changepoints.
